Overview
This project implements a Transformer-based chatbot using PyTorch. The notebook (transformer.ipynb) contains detailed steps for building, training, and evaluating a neural network model for conversational AI. Transformers are widely regarded for their effectiveness in handling sequence-to-sequence tasks such as natural language processing and machine translation.
